PART 0 - LAYOUT
Used a Layout component, instead of App,  to houseall the components... at this stage
If a component had sub-components it got a folder. Players, Player, PlayeEdit, PlayerAdd
Split Add & Edit as found it easier to build and easier to debug on error.
Used Materialize for layout and css
Static Homepage Mounts with Header/Nav and Footer
